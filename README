# To Build
In order to build this deployer into its executable form then you will need Groovy installed with GROOVY_HOME environmnent variable set. 

Once thats inplace it can be packaged using:
groovy GroovyWrapper -c -m Deployer

This will produce an executable jar file that can be run with
java -jar Deployer.jar <args>

Or, if you prefer then it can be executed in its exploded form without being built into a jar by using:
groovy Deployer

An example of the Environment.groovy configuration file will follow shortly
